	common.[ch]/hashtable.c:
		-New string comparison function for speedup.  Use for hashtable lookups and segment tag
		checks in x12parser.c.
	edival.h:
		-Remove call for EDI_SetLoopID (also removed from complextype.c).  After consideration,
		I don't think this function has a place at this level of the EDI parsing stack.  Validation
		of a loop's implementation should be higher in the application level.  Not to mention the
		added complexity required to validate this.
		-Simplify the types of elements allowed for validation.  Many were removed 
		from "enum EDI_PrimitiveDataType".
		-Changed EDI_AddSyntaxNote to accept an integer array rather than a variable 
		length argument list.
	schema.[ch]:
		-Added a length argument to EDI_ValidateElement.  This removes the need for strlen and
		helps remove a performance bottleneck.  The element size is counted while tokenizing.
		-Added new field to schema to hold previous element pointer.  Minor performance gain.
		-Added support for date and time field validation.  N.b. the minimum and maximum field sizes
		for date and time fields will be ignored.  Time elements must be numeric 4-8 and date fields
		must be numeric 6-8.  Both are checked to hold valid contents once those size/type contraints
		are met.
		
	x12parser.c:
		-Use new string comparison function where appropriate for speed gains.
		-Call EDI_ValidateSyntax on segments and composite elements.
		

2006-08-19:
	Many updates and bugfixes through out the library.  Also included a sample program
	for parsing and validating an 837 file.

2006-08-07:
	ediparse.c:
		-Remove dependance of a schema from the parser.
		-Add function for removal of schema from the parser.
	schema.(c/h):
		-Remove dependance of schema from the parser.
		-Convert allocation/creation functions to accept mem. function pointers or
		void to use default malloc/alloc/free.
		-Tightened code in the segment position validation function.
		-Function SchemaDestroy becomes public -> SchemaFree (edival.h)
	x12parser:
		-Add missing component validation call.
		-Replace element validation calls with macro.
		-Prevent validation attempts for elements contained in an invalid segment.

2006-08-06:
	edival.h:
		Added functions to retrieve a schema's id and to retrieve the current schema from the parser.
		Added element and component offsets to the callbacks for each type of token.
	schema.h:
		Added the identifier attribute to the schema to aid in caching.
	x12parser:
		Added segment offset count to the parser.
