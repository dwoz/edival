scan997 is a basic program to verify the contents of a 997 file.
All validation information is hardcoded in the program.  Normally this information 
would be loaded from a database/file dynamically.  To build scan997, run:

gcc scan997.c -ledival -o scan997

If you have built edival (required) but not done a "make install" run

gcc scan997.c -I../lib -L../lib -ledival -o scan997
